      <p>Jarad Anthony Higgins (December 2, 1998 â€“ December 8, 2019), known professionally as Juice Wrld was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter from Chicago, Illinois. His songs have been played on the music streaming platform Spotify over one billion times and some peaked on the Billboard Hot 100. "Lucid Dreams", along with his earlier hit single "All Girls Are the Same", helped him secure a recording contract with Lil Bibby's Grade A Productions and Interscope Records. He derived his stage name from late American rapper Tupac Shakur and his part in the film Juice and that it represents taking over the world.</p>
      <p>Juice WRLD is considered one of hip-hop's modern day pioneers. With a career that has been nothing short of meteoric, he currently stands as one of the most listened to rappers in the game and finds himself nominated for "Best New Artist" at the 2019 BET Awards.</p>
      <p>"All Girls Are the Same" and "Lucid Dreams" were two of five singles included on Higgins' debut studio album Goodbye & Good Riddance (2018), which went on to become certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album enjoyed positive critical reception, and contained three other singles: "Lean wit Me", "Wasted", and "Armed and Dangerous", all of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100. After collaborating with Future on the mixtape Wrld on Drugs (2018), Higgins released his second studio album Death Race for Love (2019), which reached number one on the Billboard 200. It contains the singles "Robbery" and "Hear Me Calling".</p>
      <p>Higgins grew up playing piano, drums, and guitar, turning to rap freestyling in high school. Influenced by rock music and Chicago drill from Lil Durk and Chief Keef, Higgins began recording as Juice TheKidd, a moniker derived from his haircut, which resembled 2Pac's in the film Juice. </p>
